# The Odyssey of Rumais - The Cybersecurity Maverick

## Chapter One: The Genesis
My journey began at Soften Technologies, not as a mere Junior Network Engineer, but as a digital pioneer. There, amidst routers and switches, I unraveled the secrets of data flow, setting the cornerstone for my future endeavors.

## Chapter Two: The Rise
At Thomsun Infocare LLP, as a Junior Cybersecurity Engineer, I embarked on an odyssey of discovery. Conducting VAPT on ERP applications, I navigated through the maze of vulnerabilities, each discovery a triumph in its own right.

## Chapter Three: The Vanguard
Today, at DTS Solution, I am the cyber sentinel, a guardian in the world of digital threats. My arsenal brims with sophisticated tools like Atomic Redteam, Vectr, Wazuh, and Crowdstrike. Here, I do not just perform a role; I lead a crusade against cyber threats, crafting strategies and innovations in the realm of threat detection, attack simulation, and cybersecurity resilience.

## The Compendium of Skills and Wisdom
- **Certifications**: My journey is adorned with accolades of knowledge â€“ CPENT, CEH, Microsoft Security Fundamentals, and Azure Fundamentals. Each certification is a chapter in my book of cyber expertise.
- **Technical Prowess**: Fluent in the languages of Python and Bash, I navigate the seas of Kali Linux, Parrot, and Ubuntu, wielding tools like Metasploit, Burp Suite, and SQL Map, each a weapon in my cyber armory.

## The Continuous Quest
- **Conferences & Workshops**: My quest for knowledge has taken me to the gates of RED TEAM SECURITY SUMMIT and the halls of ISOEH.
- **Lifelong Learning**: From the corridors of TryHackMe to the battlegrounds of HackTheBox, my journey of learning never ceases.
